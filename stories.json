However, he only addressed my friends, making eye contact with them alone, and in the end, only had them sign up, completely skipping over me. What, do I look like I can’t understand people, or like I'm invisible, or do I look like someone who should be receiving donations instead? I felt shocked, confused, and disappointed, especially since my German friends acted like it was no big deal, which hurt me even more."

Once, when I told him I didn’t need a receipt as usual, he replied, “Of course, you don’t.” That was when I realized he was targeting me, and it felt extremely uncomfortable. After that, I never went back to that store, opting to walk ten minutes longer to a place with a self-checkout."

I was just returning home and encountered people who picked a fight for no reason, making me feel depressed and immediately lose my sense of belonging in my own building."
